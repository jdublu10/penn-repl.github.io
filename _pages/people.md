<p class="nn">
Joey is a PhD student advised by Steve Zdancewic and Konrad KÃ¶rding at the University of Pennsylvania. His research explores the feasability of designing programming languages for the brain. His current work exploits the semantics of linear logic to design typed functional programming languages which compile to neural networks. More details can be found at his personal site.
