##  What is REPL?

REPL (Research Experiences for undergraduates in Programming Languages) integrates students with [PLClub](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/) Pennâ€™s research group in programming languages. Over 10 week students will conduct [research](research) with faculty and graduate advisors, attend PLClub's weekly lab meeting, and attend [PLClub+](plclub+) which comprises several activities meant to prepare undergraduates for graduate study in programming languages. Housing, travel, and a $6,000 stipend are provided for participants. Our objectives in REPL are the following.

 1. **Engage students in research**
 2. **Teach the prerequisites for research in programming languages**
 3. **Teach how to read and analyze research papers**
 4. **Expose students to ongoing research trends in programming language theory**

## Who should apply to REPL?
Our focus is to provide these opportunities to those underrepresented in the programming languages research community. Between 2012-2018, the Computing Research Association (CRA) Taulbee survey shows only 4.9% of PhD students in computer science who study programming languages and compilers are domestic underrepresented students. These include citizens and permanent residents whose race/ethnicity are Native American, Alaskan Native, Black/African American, Hispanic, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. The same survey also shows that amongst all PhD student respondents in programming languages and compilers, only 10% are women. To our knowledge, REPL is the first REU (NSF or otherwise) designed for underrepresented students and whose focus is programming languages. Programming languages themselves are the basic tools by which all modern software is constructed, so studying how to improve the reliability, quality, and performance of programming languages is essential to modern computing. All that said, a student with any of the following traits is especially encouraged to [apply](apply).
- **Underrepresented in programming languages research i.e. Women, Native Americans, Native Alaskans/Hawaiians, African Americans, Hispanics, or Pacific Islanders.**
- **Mathematics or Computer Science major interested in formal proofs for properties of programs and programming languages**
- **Want to pursue a PhD in Computer Science**
- **Either a sophomore or junior in undergrad**

## When is REPL?
REPL takes place over 10 weeks in the summer, exact timing subject to on-campus housing availability. Start date is approximately June 1st, end date is approximately August 10th.
