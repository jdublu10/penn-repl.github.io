##  What is REPL?

REPL (Research Experiences for undergraduates in Programming Languages) catalyzes the next generation of programming languages research by providing structured research opportunities for undergraduate students. REPL integrates its students with “PLClub,” Penn’s research group in programming languages. Over 10 weeks, students conduct cutting edge research, master the relevant prerequisites, read and analyze prior work, understand ongoing research trends, and learn how to prepare competitive PhD applications. REPL’s focus is to provide these opportunities especially to those underrepresented in the programming languages research community. Between 2012-2018, the Computing Research Association (CRA) Taulbee survey shows only 4.9% of PhD students in computer science who study programming languages and compilers are domestic underrepresented students. To our knowledge, REPL is the first REU (NSF or otherwise) designed for underrepresented students and whose focus is programming languages.  Programming languages themselves are the basic tools by which all modern software is constructed, so studying how to improve the reliability, quality, and performance of programming languages is essential to modern computing systems.
